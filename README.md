# Library-Lending-System
I have developed a Library Lending System that provides an efficient and user-friendly solution. The proposed system aims to transform the way libraries handle book borrowings. By leveraging the power of linked lists as the underlying data structure, it allows librarians to focus on providing great services rather than being burdened by administrative responsibilities. This approach provides flexibility and versatility by utilizing a multi-file project structure, dynamic arrays, functions, and classes. The Library Lending System has an easy-to-use interface that streamlines the lending procedure. The system offers a variety of features, allowing librarians to effortlessly add and delete info, edit, view, and search lists, ensuring the records are correct and up to date.Libraries may improve their overall operational efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and
provide a seamless borrowing experience for their patrons by implementing this software solution. Libraries may establish a favorable atmosphere for reading, research, and information sharing by automating record-keeping, accurately tracking due dates, and streamlining member administration. In addition, the system also enables librarians to provide personalized services,
propose appropriate titles, and cultivate a lively community of readers and learners.
